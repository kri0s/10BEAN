		<h1>Our Story:</h1>
		<p>Everything we do here originated from one original idea: Make people happy through coffee.  If there is anything at all that we want you to know about, it is that we are PASSIONATE about coffee.
		When we opened up our very first shop in Orlando, Florida in 2016 and people were constantly asking us if they could get a brew to make on their own at home, we knew it was time to expand.</p>
		<p>Well, now we've finally developed an app where you can order our signature coffee beans straight to your door!
			Now you can have all of your favorite blends of ours for your morning coffee without ever having to leave the house.
			Still love the way we make them? You can also order your drink through the app and have us deliver to you as well!
